# Paper-Company
A paper company is interested in making its operations more efficient. They collect data on the total manufacturing cost per month (in dollars) (COST), the total 
production of paper per month (in tons) (PAPER), the total number of machine hours per month (MACHINE), the total variable overhead cost permonth 
(in thousands of dollars) (OVERHEAD) and the totalnumber of labor hours each month (LABOR). I will fit a multiple regression using cost as the response variable, and
the other four variables as explanatory variables. Write downthe regression equation,Conduct the F-test for the overall fit of the regression, and write
conclusions can you draw?Also write what proportion of the variation in cost has been explained by the regression?
